During this period , we started of with the basics such as the various types of HTML tags and what html is .
HTML is Hyper-Text markup language and it is the basic structure of a website.Its basically the backbone or building block to any website.
And it has many tags which are like its elements or tools.Some of them are
<a> anchor tag  which is used for referencing any url or links
<br>  break tag for line break
<img > image tag used for entering images
<script> script tag used to write javascript in html or reference it to an exterenal js using src=""
<p> paragraph tag is used to write paragraphs in body
<h1,2,3..>heading tags used to write headings with their size proprtional to their numbers
<header> header tag used for header
<section> used for sectioning your components in the body
and so on...
  
The next thing we learned was css and it stands for cascading-style sheets.And its basically the make up of our HTML , we use it to present and design our html nicely
  
  3 types of css 
  
  Inline -is when we use it in the body section attached with the element 
  
  Internal- is when we create a style tag in the head and style elements particularly
  
  external-separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes  written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag
